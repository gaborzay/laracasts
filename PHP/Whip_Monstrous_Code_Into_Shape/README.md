1. Consider Form Objects: A form object manages a single form in your application. It handles validation, potentially authorization, and finally - if you wish - persistence. In this lesson, we'll write an implementation from scratch, and then switch over to reviewing Laravel's form request classes and how they fit into the mix.
2. Consider Use Cases: A use case is nothing more than a description of how a user should interact with a particular part of your system. Traditionally, this description may be written on something as simple as an index card. However, what if we applied this approach to the code, itself? What might that look like?
3. Consider Domain Events: If it makes sense for your application, you might consider leveraging domain events and listeners to construct a complex set of functionality.
